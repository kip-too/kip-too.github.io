### About Me
Hi there! My name is Kiptoo, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for building innovative solutions to complex problems.

 I've had the privilege of working on a wide range of projects, from frontend development with Dart and Flutter to backend development with Java, Quarkus, and Spring Boot.

One of my favorite parts of being a developer is the opportunity to constantly learn and grow. Whether I'm exploring new technologies or refining my existing skills, I'm always striving to be the best programmer I can be.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors, playing chess, and studying data analytics with Julia. I believe that a well-rounded life is essential to being a successful developer, and I try to bring that same sense of balance to my work.

If you're interested in working together on a project or just want to chat about software development, feel free to reach out to me using the contact form on this site. I'd love to hear from you!
